I am creating a presentation titled "{presentation_title}". 
            These are the existing slide titles: {existing_titles}.
            Suggest 5-10 new slide titles that would complement the current slides. 
            Please output the response in the following JSON format:
            ```json
            {
                "slide_titles": [
                    "New Title 1",
                    "New Title 2",
                    "New Title 3",
                    ...
                ]
            }
